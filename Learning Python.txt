Notes for Python

Q: What is a statement?
A: In programming we call anything that carries out some action a statement.

Print Statements:
Two different types of Python. Python 2 and Python 3.
Python 2 = print ""
Python 3 = print("")

Strings:
Text in Python is considered a specefic type of data called a String.
EXAMPLE:
print "This is a good string"
print 'You can use single quotes or double quotes for a string'

a string needs to be opened and closed by the same type of quote mark.
We can combine multiple strings using +, like so:
print "Hello " + "Oliver_Evans"
print "This is " + "a good string"

Handling Errors:
Here are some common errors that we might run into when printing strings (EOL):
print "Mismatched quotes will cause a SyntaxError'
print Without quotes will cause a NameError
No quotes = NameError

Variables:
Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.
greeting_message = "Welcome to Codecademy!"
current_excercise = 5

In the above example, we defined a variable called greeting_message and set it equal to the string “Welcome to Codecademy!”. 
It also defined a variable called current_exercise and set it equal to the number 5.

Arithmetic:
Examples:
addition = 12381 + 91817
subtraction = 981 - 312
multiplication = 38 * 902
division = 540 / 45
combinations = 129 * 1345 + 120 / 6 - 12
remainder = 1398 % 11

Updating Variables:
Changing the contents of a variable is one of the essential operations.
fish_in_clarks_pond = 50
 
print "Catching fish"
 
number_of_fish_caught = 10
fish_in_clarks_pond = fish_in_clarks_pond - number_of_fish_caught

Comments:
A line of text preceded by a # is called a comment. 

Numbers:
The simplest kind of number in Python is the integer, which is a whole number with no decimal point:
int1 = 1
int2 = 10
int3 = -5

A number with a decimal point is called a float.
float1 = 1.0
float2 = 10.
float3 = -5.5

You can also define a float using scientific notation, with e indicating the power of 10:
# this evaluates to 150:
float4 = 1.5e2 

Two Types of Division:
